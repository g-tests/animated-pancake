[[domain-model]]
== Domain model

In order to control IoT appliances in a RESTful manner, the API treats devices as resources.
Each device is represented by an *endpoint* resource that has sub-resources: *editable state*, *programs* and *jobs*.

- *Endpoint*
    is an abstraction for any kind of device controlled by this API

- *Editable state of an endpoint*
    is a resource providing access to endpoint's parameters that can be changed immediately, like state of a light
    in a room (on/off) or target temperature of an air conditioner

- *Programs*
    is a collection resource representing routines the device firmware can do on its own.
    For example, a wash machine might have different programs for washing different kinds of clothes.
    Programs can have their specific sets of parameters, like water temperature and drying rpm value
    for a wash machine program.

- *Jobs*
    is a collection resource representing queue of tasks to perform a program.
    Single job specifies a program and a set of parameter values for the program. For the wash machine example,
    a job can represent request to start "cotton washing" program at 19:00, with temperature set to 40 C

[[endpoints]]
== Endpoints
The API provides read-only access to endpoints, as the client can only control existing devices and cannot install
a wash machine using RESTful API.

[[endpoints-listing]]
=== Listing available endpoints
To list all endpoints available, use following `GET` request:

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/endpoints-collection/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/endpoints-collection/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response description

include::{snippets}/endpoints-collection/response-fields.adoc[]



[[endpoint-selection]]
=== Selecting an endpoint
To get a single endpoint, use following `GET` request:

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/endpoint-item/curl-request.adoc[]

[[editable-state]]
== Endpoint's state
Endpoint state is a sub-resource of an endpoint which exists permanently and can be either read or updated.
Note that updates to this resource are validated against json schema specified in corresponding endpoint's field.

include::{snippets}/endpoint-state/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response description

include::{snippets}/endpoint-state/response-fields.adoc[]



[[editable-state-put]]
=== Updating endpoint's state

To update an endpoint's editable state, use following `PUT` request:

include::{snippets}/endpoint-state-upd/curl-request.adoc[]

==== URI parameters

include::{snippets}/endpoint-state-upd/path-parameters.adoc[]


==== Example response

include::{snippets}/endpoint-state-upd/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response description

include::{snippets}/endpoint-state-upd/request-fields.adoc[]




[[programs]]
== Endpoint's programs

include::{snippets}/job-list/path-parameters.adoc[]


==== Example response

include::{snippets}/job-list/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response description

include::{snippets}/job-list/response-fields.adoc[]


[[jobs-selection]]
=== Selecting a job

To get a job by endpoint and id, use following `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/job-get/http-response.adoc[]

==== Response description

include::{snippets}/job-get/response-fields.adoc[]


[[jobs-creation]]
=== Enqueueing a new job
To create a new job, use following `POST` request to job collection URI:

include::{snippets}/job-create/request-fields.adoc[]

==== URI parameters

include::{snippets}/job-create/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/job-create/http-response.adoc[]


[[jobs-update]]
=== Updating a pending job

To update existing job, use following `PUT` request to job URI:

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/job-upd/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Request description

include::{snippets}/job-upd/request-fields.adoc[]

==== URI parameters

include::{snippets}/job-upd/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/job-upd/http-response.adoc[]


[[jobs-delete]]
=== Removing a pending job
